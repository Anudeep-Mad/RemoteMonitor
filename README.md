# RemoteMonitor
This is the code to retrieve the repository data from the INFA repositories


INFORMATICA gives us a SOAP end point to access the folders and other details from the repository.

I have used Apache Axis 2 API to create SOAP stubs from that service and created REST end points to expose data in JSON format.
